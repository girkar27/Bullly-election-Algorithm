# Distributed System Leader Election Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of a leader election algorithm for distributed systems. The algorithm follows these steps:

## 1. Initialization

When a process suspects that the current leader has failed (e.g., due to a timeout in receiving expected messages from the leader), it initiates an election process.

## 2. Election Initiation

The process initiating the election sends an election message to all processes with higher IDs, indicating its intention to become the leader.

## 3. Acknowledgment

Processes with higher IDs respond to the election message by sending acknowledgment messages back to the initiating process. This indicates that they are still active.

## 4. Timeout Handling

If no response is received within a specified timeout period, the initiating process assumes that it has the highest priority among the active processes and declares itself as the new leader.

## 5. Election Resolution

If all higher ID processes respond with acknowledgment messages, the initiating process declares itself as the leader and notifies all processes by sending a leader message.

## 6. Recovery

If a previously failed process recovers and rejoins the system, it initiates an election process to determine the new leader.

## Getting Started

To get started with the implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any dependencies required for the implementation.
3. Run the implementation on your distributed system.
